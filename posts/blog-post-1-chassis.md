# First prototype of the chassis

We have completed our first prototype of the chassis. It consist of three parts:
1. Outer shell
2. Inner body
3. PCB tray

The chassis is printed out of PETG with 0.2mm layer height and 2 wall lines. Due to printer limitations, we had to print it vertically, which may be detrimental to the Y-axis strength. However, we expect the layer adhesion to be adequate and we will test whether it withstands 20G's.

We will use brass inserts for sturdy threads that can be re-used, since we expect to take apart the satellite many times. Easy access to internals is a must in the field, and damaged threads would cause many issues including impaired integrity. Especially the PCB tray must have easy access to power the satellite on and change the batteries.

Our next revision will contain mounts for the parachute along some support structures, strenghtened PCB tray, better holes for the brass inserts and a couple of corrected measurements.

Some may already realize our idea from the design ;) (hint: it features a lot of wire)
