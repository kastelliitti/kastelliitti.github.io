# Coil wrapping station

We have designed a coil wrapping station for our satellite. Our secondary mission consists of a coil around the satellite, which induces a voltage that we can measure. Of course, we need to wrap the wire first. That's where the wrapping station comes into play.

The design is very simple, consisting of three distinct parts.

1. Bottom of inner body adapter
2. Top of inner body adapter
3. Two legs with bearings that are friction fit.

This will greatly help us to gain a consistent spacing. It's a small thing, but a bunch of good small things will yield an excellent unit.
