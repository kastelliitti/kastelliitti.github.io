# The Parachute
The process of making the parachute started with a bunch of calculations, about the size and possible shape of the parachute.
The first thing to calculate was what would eventually be the whole surface area of the parachute.

We had already decided with the team to make an octagonal parachute. After the surface area was figured out, it was easy to get to know the measurements of the eight triangles we would need.

We ended up with a decorated black parachute for our satellite.
